I have attempted to make a program that uses letterboxd.com and the OMDB api to find "hidden gem" movies that would make good additions to a theoretical streaming service. This program uses beautifulsoup to scrape various lists across letterboxd.com for highly rated films (4.0 or above). The OMDB api is then used to look up data pertaining to these movies (Title, Year, Box Office, Budget, IMDB rating, Genre, Director, Actors, Plot, Awards, Runtime, Country and Language will be collected if available). It then returns movies released prior to 2020 that underperformed in the box office (<$17 million). While both stats are adjustable, $17 million is the average Box Office performance in the US and it is my opinion that 2020 is plenty enough time back to reintroduce a movie to a streaming service.

In this project, I used AI to quickly analyze each film to choose the best three options to possibly acquire. Before the inclusion of deepseek, it would have taken one person a long time to analyze each individual movie. Deepseek efficiently analyzes all of the movies and returns its recommendations along with justifications.

To use, run main.py and the program should run itself all the way through.
