        "key_insights": "Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a masterclass in visual storytelling and emotional restraint, celebrated for its exquisite cinematography and profound exploration of female desire and artistic creation. Its commercial obscurity stems from its deliberate pacing and subtitled intimacy, which, while limiting mainstream appeal, have cemented its status as a modern arthouse treasure. The film\u2019s impact lies in its quiet yet powerful reclamation of the female gaze, resonating deeply with critics and cinephiles alike.",
