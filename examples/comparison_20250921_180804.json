      "key_insights": "Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a masterclass in visual storytelling and restrained emotion, using its painterly cinematography and deliberate pacing to explore themes of female gaze and desire with profound intimacy. Its commercial underperformance stems from its slow-burn, dialogue-light approach and subtitled arthouse nature, yet it has resonated deeply as a landmark in queer cinema for its authentic representation and artistic integrity."
