Some Prompts I used for deepseek are:
1. '''Analyze why this critically acclaimed movie underperformed at the box office.'''
    This prompt is important because depending on the reason for underperformance, a movie may or may not be a better choice to be aquired for a streaming service.

2. '''Provide a concise insight about why this movie is a "hidden gem" - highly rated but commercially unsuccessful.'''
   This prompt can give insight on how the film can be made commercially successful under 'our' ownership.

3. '''Based on this movie's profile, assess its likely marketing challenge.'''
   This prompt can give initial insight and direction on the marketability of the film.

4. '''Rate the audience-critic divide for this movie on a scale of 0-10.'''
   This prompt assesses how consistent the good ratings are between critics and general audiences.
   
6. '''Create a brief audience recommendation for this hidden gem.'''
   Quickly gives demographic recommendations for marketing purposes
   
8. '''Assess this hidden gem's potential for revival or rediscovery.'''
  Quickly analyzes and ranks how good each movie is for acquisition.

I found that the most effective enrichment strategy is to ask for a separate analysis of different traits and then ask for an analysis that uses information gleaned during multiple other prompts.
The deepseek portion of this assignment turned out to be one of the less difficult parts of this assignment.
I was really surprised how much analysis work I could just load onto deepseek and how effective and persuasive it was in its recommendations.
